<h3> Nowadays... </h3>

- 🏋️‍♀️ I’m currently working on Inventario, a foodstock tracker for me and my wife.
- 🎬 I’m currently learning to use Three.js and GSAP.
- 🥳 I really like to collaborate and build beautiful UIs so let's have a chat!

<p>I've been working as a software developer for more than four years now and along the way I found out two things, I really love programming and I truly enjoy working in the frontend.
  <br><br> One thing I'd like to achieve as the time goes by, is to become really good at creating ghaphs and animations. The things you can create with time and effort are incredible.</p>
